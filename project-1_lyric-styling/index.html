        <p>Do not ask your children
            to strive for extraordinary lives.
            Such striving may seem admirable,
            but it is the way of foolishness.
            Help them instead to find the wonder
            and the marvel of an ordinary life.
            Show them the joy of tasting
            tomatoes, apples and pears.
            Show them how to cry
            when pets and people die.
            Show them the infinite pleasure
            in the touch of a hand.
            And make the ordinary come alive for them.
            The extraordinary will take care of itself.
