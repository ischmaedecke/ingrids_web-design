        <p>Do not ask your children <br>
            to strive for extraordinary lives.<br>
            Such striving may seem admirable, <br>
            but it is the way of foolishness.<br>
            Help them instead to find the wonder <br>
            and the marvel of an ordinary life. <br>
            Show them the joy of tasting <br>
            tomatoes, apples and pears. <br>
            Show them how to cry <br>
            when pets and people die. <br>
            Show them the infinite pleasure <br>
            in the touch of a hand. <br>
            And make the ordinary come alive for them. <br>
            The extraordinary will take care of itself. <br>

                You open the refrigerator.
                The half-filled ketchup red bottle stands out in the whiteness of the “I’ll do the groceries tomorrow” void.
